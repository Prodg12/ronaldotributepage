                             Aveiro in Santo Antonio, Madeira, Portugal. His mother was a cook, and his father

                        <p>Ronaldo played for Andorinha at the age of eight. Ronaldo's father was the kit man
                         for the team. Cristiano Ronaldo started to play football as a result of his father's
                          influence. His great talent was evident from a very young age.</p>

                        local club Nacional. While at Nacional, his coach saw his great talent and committed
                         himself to train Ronaldo to be a great football player. The intense training that he 
                         received at Nacional positioned him for greatness.</p>
